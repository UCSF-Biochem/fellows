 Isha received her PhD from the Harvard-MIT program in Health Sciences and Technology. Her graduate work in Vamsi Mootha's lab led to the foundational discovery that hypoxia could serve as a therapy for mitochondrial disorders. This seemingly contradictory approach extended the lifespan of a mitochondrial disease mouse model by five-fold. A Phase 1 clinical trial is already underway based on this initial discovery. Through this work, Isha has become enthralled by the essential role oxygen plays in dictating cellular metabolism and mammalian physiology. In her independent research program, she plans to use systems-level approaches to identify novel hypoxia adaptations with therapeutic implications for ischemic conditions such as stroke. Additionally, she hopes to identify common conditions which benefit from turning the "oxygen dial" to low or high oxygen, laying the groundwork to understand the role of oxygen in aging and age-associated conditions.
