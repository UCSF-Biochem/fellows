 Kevin completed his training at Stanford University where his dissertation in Mark Krasnow’s lab made a foundational contribution towards understanding the cellular and molecular bases of breathing rhythm generation. Breathing is a simple, essential behavior triggered roughly fifteen times per minute by the breathing pacemaker, the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a brainstem nucleus of several thousand neurons. Kevin defined more than 50 molecularly distinct preBötC neural subtypes and in initial studies characterizing the first five subtypes, he discovered that molecular defined preBötC cell types that have exquisitely specific, distinct and interesting functions in the breathing behavior. For example, he identified ~200 preBötC neurons that are sufficient to induce and selectively required for the control of sighing, a specific breath type, and ~175 different neurons that are expendable for breathing rhythm generation and instead project to, synapse with, and activate a higher order brain center that promotes arousal, perhaps explaining the connection between breathing and calmness or anxiety. The discovery of dozens of molecularly distinct preBötC neural cell types, each with an important and distinct role in breathing, suggests that a subset will be critical for generating a breath and controlling the pace of breathing. At UCSF, Kevin will continue his dissection of preBötC cell types in order to identify the key neural types and the molecules they use to generate and pace breathing.
