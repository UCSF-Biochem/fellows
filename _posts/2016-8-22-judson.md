Robert conducted his dissertation research in Robert Blellochâ€™s laboratory in the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF. There he pioneered the use of microRNAs for epigenetic reprogramming and discovered two conserved microRNA families that promote the conversion of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Using an siRNA approach to map genetic interactions, he further identified networks of microRNA-regulated genes that cooperate in the stabilization of the fibroblastic cell state. Coordinated inhibition of these networks sensitizes skin cells to epigenetic reprogramming, thereby making them more susceptible to the reacquisition of embryonic programs.  As a fellow at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Robert is now further developing these tools to dissect the similar networks that stabilize the melanocytic cell state. The incidence of melanoma is on the rise and, if given the opportunity to metastasize, the disease is usually lethal. With the goal of developing novel strategies to more accurately determine the metastatic potential of early lesions, Robert is using a combination of primary tumor sequencing, genetic interaction mapping, genome editing, and microRNA manipulation to study the networks of genes that prevent normal melanocytes and primary melanomas from reacquiring embryonic programs.
