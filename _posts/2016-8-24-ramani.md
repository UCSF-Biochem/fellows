Vijay competed his PhD studies in Jay Shendure’s lab at the University of Washington, where he invented high-throughput molecular methods to study biological phenomena at scale. These methods included an assay for studying RNA structure, as well as single-cell genomic assays reliant on in situ DNA barcoding of intact cells and nuclei, to make genome-wide measurements in thousands of single-cells without ever resorting to single-cell isolation. As a Sandler Fellow, Vijay’s lab will continue to develop novel, high-throughput technologies to study biology at the level of single cells and single molecules. His lab will also apply these tools to better understand how genes are regulated at the levels of transcription & translation, specifically in the context of metabolic perturbation.
