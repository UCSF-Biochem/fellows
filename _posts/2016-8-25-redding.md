 Sy did his graduate work at Columbia University in the laboratories of Eric Greene and David Reichman. Using a single molecule imaging technique called DNA curtains, Sy investigated the physical mechanisms through which proteins locate, recognize, and extract genomic information. His research has explored how bacterial RNA polymerase locates promoter sequences within the genome, the mechanism of sequence alignment during homologous recombination, and how viruses are selectively recognized and destroyed by the CRISPR immune system.  At UCSF, Sy will use DNA curtains to explore how protein-DNA interactions change as DNA is organized into chromatin: how nature balances the individual protein’s need to access DNA against the cell’s pressure to organize the genome.
