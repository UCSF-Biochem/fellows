Faranak completed her graduate training in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenz Studer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. During her PhD, she pioneered strategies to derive highly specific lineages of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) from human pluripotent stem cells and demonstrated their potential in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. As a UCSF Sandler Fellow, she is focused on utilizing this unique framework to study the human PNS development and function in health and disease, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies for peripheral neuropathies.
