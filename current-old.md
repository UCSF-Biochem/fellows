## UCSF Sandler Fellows:

Faranak Fattahi, Ph.D. Faranak completed her graduate training in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenz Studer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. During her PhD, she pioneered strategies to derive highly specific lineages of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) from human pluripotent stem cells and demonstrated their potential in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. As a UCSF Sandler Fellow, she is focused on utilizing this unique framework to study the human PNS development and function in health and disease, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies for peripheral neuropathies.

Isha Jain, Ph.D. Isha received her PhD from the Harvard-MIT program in Health Sciences and Technology. Her graduate work in Vamsi Mootha's lab led to the foundational discovery that hypoxia could serve as a therapy for mitochondrial disorders. This seemingly contradictory approach extended the lifespan of a mitochondrial disease mouse model by five-fold. A Phase 1 clinical trial is already underway based on this initial discovery. Through this work, Isha has become enthralled by the essential role oxygen plays in dictating cellular metabolism and mammalian physiology. In her independent research program, she plans to use systems-level approaches to identify novel hypoxia adaptations with therapeutic implications for ischemic conditions such as stroke. Additionally, she hopes to identify common conditions which benefit from turning the "oxygen dial" to low or high oxygen, laying the groundwork to understand the role of oxygen in aging and age-associated conditions.

Robert Judson, Ph.D. Robert conducted his dissertation research in Robert Blellochâ€™s laboratory in the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF. There he pioneered the use of microRNAs for epigenetic reprogramming and discovered two conserved microRNA families that promote the conversion of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Using an siRNA approach to map genetic interactions, he further identified networks of microRNA-regulated genes that cooperate in the stabilization of the fibroblastic cell state. Coordinated inhibition of these networks sensitizes skin cells to epigenetic reprogramming, thereby making them more susceptible to the reacquisition of embryonic programs.  As a fellow at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Robert is now further developing these tools to dissect the similar networks that stabilize the melanocytic cell state. The incidence of melanoma is on the rise and, if given the opportunity to metastasize, the disease is usually lethal. With the goal of developing novel strategies to more accurately determine the metastatic potential of early lesions, Robert is using a combination of primary tumor sequencing, genetic interaction mapping, genome editing, and microRNA manipulation to study the networks of genes that prevent normal melanocytes and primary melanomas from reacquiring embryonic programs.
